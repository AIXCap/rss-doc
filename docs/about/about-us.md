## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide efficient information aggregation solutions through technological innovation and user-oriented approaches, enabling everyone to easily control their information flow and avoid the hassle of ineffective information.

## Our Story

`RssTabs` originated from people's pursuit of efficient information management and the renaissance of `RSS` in the `AI` era.

In traditional information management, people needed to spend considerable time and effort managing various information sources, including emails, news, social media, and more. Although `RSS` has existed for many years, it remained a cumbersome task, and due to various historical reasons, its usage rate and user base were not high, with many people not even knowing about it.

With the development of `AI`, people began to discover various possibilities for automated management.

Indeed, the advent of the `AI` era has shown us a different future for `RSS`.

We began to envision whether we could create a unique `RSS` platform based on `AI` that would integrate scattered content sources in one place, allowing users to easily manage and subscribe to their favorite content while providing interesting features such as `AI`-based personalized recommendations, `AI` summaries, `AI` translation, and more.

Thus, we began dedicating ourselves to creating an intelligent, intuitive, and powerful `RSS` information management platform - `RssTabs`.
