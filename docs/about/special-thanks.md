Since the inception and release of `RssTabs`, we have received many expectations and suggestions from our friends, which drives us to continuously improve and iterate to provide better services to our users. We are very grateful to all contributors whose support and contributions have made `RssTabs` more powerful and complete.

If you are a power user of `RssTabs`, if you have created multiple widely-followed `Poly Feeds`, if you frequently submit optimization suggestions, improvement ideas, or `BUG` reports that we have incorporated, if you become our promotion ambassador - yes, you will be nominated by `RssTabs` for the honorary title of contributor. With your authorization, we will publicly display your information on the `RssTabs` special thanks list, and in the future, you will receive priority access to the latest features and privileges provided by `RssTabs`!
