## What is Poly Feed?

In the `RssTabs` platform, a `Poly Feed` refers to an aggregated feed composed of multiple RSS feed sources (`Single Feed`) as its data foundation, serving as an advanced form of providing personalized, multi-dimensional information access to users. `Poly Feed` allows users to flexibly integrate and filter content to achieve more precise and efficient information subscription and management.
