## What is RssTabs?

## What is a Single Feed?

In `RssTabs`, we refer to conventional `RSS` feed sources as `Single Feed`.

A `Single Feed` is defined as a single, indivisible `RSS` feed source. In `RssTabs`, `Single Feed` is the basic unit for providing subscription and content management to users, serving as the foundation for `Poly Feed` data services.

## What is a Poly Feed?

In `RssTabs`, we refer to the aggregation of multiple `RSS` feed sources as a `Poly Feed`.

Using `RssTabs` to create a `Poly Feed`, you can select from thousands of `Single Feeds` we provide, or parse your own `RSS` subscription URLs into `Single Feeds`. Additionally, you can add keywords, tags, and other information, and we'll use `AI` to provide more granular and precise information.

You can also create a `Poly Feed` by parsing `OPML` files containing multiple `RSS` feed sources, or `OPML` files exported from other platforms.

## The Future of RssTabs

In the future, `RssTabs` will continue to improve and iterate to provide better services.

We will provide more powerful content recommendation algorithms, combining `AI` to deeply analyze user preferences. We will also continuously optimize support for aggregating more content types (such as images, videos, audio, etc.) to meet the needs of more users.

Additionally, we will develop community features, allowing users to share and follow `Poly Feeds`, as well as comment and like. This will provide more interaction opportunities for users, and in the future, you may even earn income by publishing `Poly Feeds`.
