# What is RssTabs?

## Introduction

`RssTabs` is an information aggregation platform based on `AI + RSS` technology, designed to help users efficiently manage feed sources, aggregate content, and optimize their information acquisition experience through a series of interesting features such as `AI` personalized recommendations, `AI` summaries, `AI` translation, and more.

`RssTabs` originated from people's dual pursuit of information management freedom and efficiency, as well as the renaissance of `RSS` in the `AI` era.

In traditional information management, people needed to spend considerable time and effort managing various information sources, including emails, news, social media, and more. Although `RSS` has existed for many years, it remained a cumbersome task, and due to various historical reasons, its usage rate and user base were not high, with many people not even knowing about it.

With the development of `AI`, people began to discover various possibilities for automated management.

Indeed, the advent of the `AI` era has shown us a different future for `RSS`.

We began to envision whether we could create a unique `RSS` platform based on `AI` that would integrate scattered content sources in one place, allowing users to easily manage and subscribe to their favorite content while providing interesting features such as `AI`-based personalized recommendations, `AI` summaries, `AI` translation, and more.

Thus, we began dedicating ourselves to creating an intelligent, intuitive, and powerful `RSS` information management platform - `RssTabs`.

## Feature Highlights

`RssTabs` is not just a simple `RSS` reader, but an information management tool that integrates aggregation, recommendation, and interaction.

### `AI+RSS` Dual-Core Drive

Users can use both traditional manual `RSS` subscription methods and let `AI` automatically capture and subscribe to potentially interesting content sources.

### Seamless RSS Aggregation

**Automated Subscription**: Users don't need to manually add feed sources; they just need to describe topics of interest, and the system will automatically match high-quality `RSS` sources through `AI`.

**Information Aggregation**: `RssTabs` has currently indexed thousands of popular `RSS` sources globally, and we are committed to creating a panoramic information flow, providing users with a one-stop reading experience.

**Aggregated Feeds**: The core of `RssTabs` is multi-source aggregation, which we call `Poly Feed`. You can freely add and manage multiple `RSS` feed sources, while supporting various filtering conditions, using `AI` personalization to create your own customized information flow.

### Real-time Content Recommendations and Device Synchronization

Utilizing the real-time nature of `RSS` technology, combined with `AI` recommendations, to achieve precise content delivery.
Support seamless multi-platform synchronization (currently supporting Web, H5, Browser Extension, with other versions in progress).

### Localized Language Support

The `RssTabs` platform supports multiple mainstream languages including Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and more. Furthermore, `RssTabs` uses `AI` technology to implement automatic translation, allowing you to easily read content from around the world, providing users with richer information acquisition options.
