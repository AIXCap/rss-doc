# What is Poly Feed

## Introduction

In the `RssTabs` platform, a `Poly Feed` refers to an aggregated feed composed of multiple RSS feed sources (`Single Feed`) as its data foundation, serving as an advanced form of providing personalized, multi-dimensional information access to users. `Poly Feed` allows users to flexibly integrate and filter content to achieve more precise and efficient information subscription and management.

## Definition of Poly Feed

`Poly Feed` is a content combination based on multiple `Single Feeds`, where users can aggregate several RSS feed sources into a unified subscription unit based on interests, needs, or topics. In `Poly Feed`, content is not simply accumulated but is filtered, organized, and optimized through AI and algorithms to enhance information value and experience.

### Aggregation Capability
`Poly Feed` supports combining multiple `Single Feeds` together, eliminating the need to manage multiple feed sources separately.

### Intelligence
Leveraging AI technology, `Poly Feed` can provide more granular and precise content recommendations based on user-set keywords, tags, and preferences.

### High Extensibility
Users can quickly import multiple feed sources by uploading OPML files, easily converting RSS subscription data from other platforms or sources into `Poly Feed`.

### Personalized Customization
Each `Poly Feed` can be highly customized according to user needs, from data sources to content filtering to display methods, putting complete control in the users' hands.
