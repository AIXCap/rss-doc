# What is Single Feed

## Introduction

In the `RssTabs` platform, a `Single Feed` refers to an individual, indivisible RSS feed source, which is the most basic unit for user subscription and content management. Whether it's getting news, blog updates, or following the latest developments on a particular topic, `Single Feed` is the core source of these data flows.

## Definition of Single Feed

A `Single Feed` refers to an independent RSS data source, typically corresponding to a fixed URL address, representing a specific information publishing channel. For example:

- An RSS subscription address for a blog
- A content update stream from a video website
- A category subscription from a news website (such as the "Technology" channel)

In `RssTabs`, `Single Feed` not only provides content updates but also serves as the foundational data service for more complex aggregation forms (such as `Poly Feed`).
