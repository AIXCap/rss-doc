# From AI+RSS

In the modern era of internet information overload, efficiently accessing content of interest has become a significant challenge. `RSS` (`Really Simple Syndication`), with its decentralized nature and efficient information aggregation capabilities, has become an important tool for many to address this issue. However, throughout `RSS`'s development, limitations such as high usage barriers and lack of intelligent recommendations have gradually emerged. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (`AI`), `RssTabs` was born, combining `AI`'s powerful capabilities with `RSS`'s classic advantages to redefine how we access information.

## The Contradiction Between RSS and the Information Age

`RSS` was once the core tool for internet information aggregation, allowing users to easily track content sources of interest through standardized subscriptions. However, `RSS` has become somewhat outdated in many aspects:

- Massive Unorganized Information: Subscribed content is displayed chronologically, lacking priority differentiation.
- Lack of Personalization: Traditional `RSS` aggregators lack the ability to learn user interests.
- Complex Operations: Manual addition of feed sources required, resulting in high learning costs for ordinary users.
- All of this has gradually marginalized `RSS` in the mobile internet era. However, `RSS`'s openness and freedom have consistently attracted power users who hope to give `RSS` new life through modern technology.

## The Addition of AI: Intelligent Information Aggregation

The rapid development of `AI` has provided possibilities for solving `RSS`'s traditional problems. The birth of `RssTabs` combines `AI`'s capabilities with `RSS`'s openness to rebuild the information aggregation experience.
The core concepts of `RssTabs` include:

- Intelligent Recommendations: Automatically recommend content matching user interests through `AI` analysis of reading history, addressing the pain point of information overload in traditional `RSS`.
- Content Priority Sorting: Dynamically adjust the display order of subscribed content based on user behavior (clicks, dwell time, bookmarks, etc.), helping users quickly access important information.
- Semantic Understanding and Classification: `AI` technology enables `RssTabs` to automatically identify and classify subscribed content, creating more intelligent tags and groupings.
- Digest Generation: Generate more valuable content summaries for users based on `AI` automatic summarization technology, improving information readability.
- Multi-modal Integration: Support aggregation of various content forms including text, images, audio (coming soon), video (coming soon), making `RSS` no longer limited to text.

## AI's Deep Empowerment: Information Production and Consumption Loop

`RssTabs` not only focuses on the consumption end of information but will also attempt to empower content creators and producers through `AI` technology, creating a closed loop of information production and consumption:

### User-Driven Feed Production and Subscription

`RssTabs` supports users in creating customized aggregate feeds (Poly Feed) and publishing them on the platform for other users to subscribe to. Publishers can become information producers on the platform by maintaining these aggregate feeds and continuously providing high-quality content.

Meanwhile, `AI` assists feed producers in optimizing content, analyzing audience preferences, and improving the experience quality for subscribers. Through this approach, the platform forms a positive interactive ecosystem between producers and consumers.

### RSS Community Interaction (Coming Soon)

Introduce lightweight interaction features allowing users to like and comment on interesting content and add it to their own feeds.

### AI-Driven Content Generation (Planned)

In the future, `RssTabs` users will be able to quickly generate article drafts, news summaries, and even personalized emails through `RssTabs'` AI module, allowing users to publish content directly on the `RssTabs` platform, transforming `RssTabs` users from content collectors into producers.
